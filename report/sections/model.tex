\section{Road network model}
To represent a road network we model the problem as a weighted, directed graph. \\
Let G be a weighted directed graph $G(I,R)$, where $R$ is the set of roads between intersections and $I$ is the set of intersections of roads. Each intersection $I_i \in I$ is a tuple $(i_o, i_t)$ where $i_o, i_t \in I$ and represents the direction of a road from the origin intersection, $i_o$ to the target intersection $i_t$. Each road also has an associated cost, $c(r_i)$ where  $c: R \rightarrow \mathbb R_+$ is the cost function. The cost of each edge describes the preference of taking the particular road. 
We want to design an algorithm for the cost function, that dynamically change the cost for each edge, as the flow of traffic in the road network changes.
