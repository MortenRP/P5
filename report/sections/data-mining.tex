\section{Finding traffic patterns}

In order to reason about the traffic in Beijing, and provide some measure of how the previous traffic possibly affects our belief in how the future traffic situation will be in the road network, we analyse the preprocessed data to look for patterns. In this section, we consider methods for extracting such patterns and propose how to apply them on the Bejing dataset.
