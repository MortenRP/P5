\section{Problem formulation}
So far we have considered different aspects of the problem of learning traffic patterns. However, before we construct a solution, the problem should be well-defined such that a solution is clear. The problem is defined by the following problem formulation:
\\\\
\emph{How accurately can an intelligent agent learn traffic patterns by modelling the road network and traffic of Beijing, based on a map of the road network, and GPS data collected from GPS-enabled vehicles? Furthermore, how effectively can the agent be used to suggest alternative routes for drivers to avoid congestion and consequently save time, and in general obtain better utilization of the road network?}
\\\\
Decomposing the problem formulation, we get the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item How can a road network and traffic be modelled?
\item How can data be collected and communicated between GPS-devices and the agent?
\item How can the agent analyse traffic data to learn traffic patterns?
\item Can such a system deliver time savings for drivers?
\item Can such a system deliver better utilisation of road networks?
\end{itemize}

With the problem formulation defined we can now construct a solution that answers the above questions, consequently answering the problem formulation itself.

% Prob1: Can traffic patterns be identified by analysing live as well as historical GPS-data of moving vehicles, giving a more understandable picture of the traffic situation, such that road networks can be better utilised?

% input: Raw GPS data from gps devices in vehicles
% problem domain model: directed weighted graph
% problem solution model: search / constraint satisfaction problem? Search problem?
% output: "Map" of traffic incidents and congestion, where road weights have changed according to these problems
