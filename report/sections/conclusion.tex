This project presented an approach for modeling road network and traffic as weighted directed graphs with weight functions as time-based piecewise linear regression models over traffic observations of speed derived from GPS samples.

The piecewise linear regression models was found to have an average predictive accuracy of NUMBER\% of actual observed travel time on routes. This follows from several issues still present in the regression models such as limited data and improvable filtering, and could futher be improved by gathering a more useful dataset where speed is directly measured.

Furthermore the system was found to, in certain cases, be able to find alternative routes avoiding traffic congestion thus potentially provide time-savings for users of the system. By providing such a feature the system can help motorists avoid heavy traffic and be more evenly distributed on the road network.

There are many interesting areas for future work including gathering better GPS data, more accurate map-matching , optimizations in terms of utilizing advanced graph methods such as contraction hierarchies to speed up query time. Furthermore, we find it important to perform field-testing in the future, to get a much better perspective of the accuracy of the system as a whole.

To be able to collect the data needed to predict traffic patterns which our agent needs, we have constructed a client-server architecture, which is described in \ref{chap:clientserver}. The client collects data, speed, time and GPS locations, and sends that to our server where we can store the information.
