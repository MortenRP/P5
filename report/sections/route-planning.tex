In the coming section the math and algorithms used will be look at. Why they where chosen over other algorithms of there kinde.

For finding a path though the graph bidirectional search is used. The reason for this decision is that the the time for finding a path is $O(b^{(n/2)})$ where a normal Dijkstraâ€™s takes $O(b^{n})$. The problem with using a bidirectional search is to get the two patch to meet up. This is where constructive heuristic is normally used, for this project the function deskribed in section \ref{graph} is used. The next problem is how a disition about whict way to go, this is the job of the cost function. The cost function is deskribed is section \ref{graph}.

Bidirectional graph search work from a start an end node to fide a way between them. In essen one runes two Dijkstra's search on the graph.
