\section{Evaluation process}
% Why this evaluation?
In order to evaluate the solution to the problem formulation, we define some criterion for the system to fulfil and how we are going to evaluate these criteria against the system. First, we define the overall characteristics that the system must possess in order to be acceptable. Then, we describe how we will test for these characteristics.

% What is this evaluation of?



% How do we evaluate?
First, we consider how to
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, we select a route $R_{uninformed}=(n_1,...n_m)$ from the GPS data that originates in $n_1$ and ends in $n_m$, through a congested area. We then, directly from the data, determine how long it took to drive this particular route.
\item Secondly, we compute a new cost, $cost(s, t)$ for every segment $s=(n_i,n_{i+1}) for 1 \leq i \leq m$ with the cost function described in section \ref{sec:weight-function}. Let this route with the adjusted costs be $R_{adjusted}$.
\item Here, we compare $R_{uninformed}$ and $R_{adjusted}$ to see if there are any significant changes in the total cost of this route.
\item Now, we traverse the graph to find a new route, $R_{informed}$ originating in $n_1$ and ends in $n_m$ such that the route is the shortest path from $n_1$ to $n_m$ by using the cost of each segment determined by our cost function.
\item Finally, we compare $R_{informed}$ with $R_{adjusted}$ and see if $R_{informed}$ has chosen a route, that saves time in going from $n_1$ to $n_m$.
\end{enumerate}
