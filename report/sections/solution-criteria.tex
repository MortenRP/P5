\section{Solution criteria}
This section describes how the solution will be evaluated.
We have chosen that the main criteria the routes generated by our solution, are to be evaluated up against, are a similar route generated by a WMS, such as Google Maps. We will thereby examine whenver the system can generate a better route based on the traffic patterns that we identify from the historical data. This means that we should be successful in navigating people around possible traffic congestions, and other slow moving traffic.
The main solution criteria to be considered will be:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Is the average speed on the normal congested road improved?
	\item Is the cars using the navigation getting to their destination in a optimal way, not having to drive a massive detour,
	\item Is the traffic distributed in a good manner over the whole road network
	\item Is the average time spent in congestions reduced?
\end{itemize}


A hard criteria for our solution is that it has to get the vehicle from it's source start address to it's destination address, using the existing road network, and it has to comply to the restrictions that the roads have.

Besides that it is possible to look at some of the following criteria:
\todo{How and why all these criteria}
\todo{add criteria: reduction in emissions e.g. avoid stopping the vehicle}

\todo{Review how we can measure if we obtain better road utilization}
