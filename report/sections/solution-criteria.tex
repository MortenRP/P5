\section{Solution criteria}
%Hvordan kan vi vurdere om l√∏sningen er tilfredsstillende?
We have chosen that the main criteria the routes generated by our solution, are to be evaluated up against, are a similar route generated by Google maps. And thereby examine whever we are generating a better route based on the traffic patterns that we have identified from the historical data. This means that we should be succesfull in navigating people arround possible traffic congestions, and other slow moving traffic. 

\textit{A hard criteria for our solution is that it has to get the vehicle from it's source start address to it's destination address, using the existing road network, and it has to comply to the restrictions that the roads have.}

Besides that it is possible to look at some of the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is the average speed on the normal congested road improved
	\item Is the cars using the navigation getting to their destination in a optimal way, not having to drive a massive detour,
	\item Is the traffic distributed in a good manner over the whole road network
	\item Is the time spent in congestions reduced
\end{itemize}
