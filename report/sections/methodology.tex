\section{Methodology}
For the project we will be using a GPS data set from Beijing from 10.000 taxies over a period of a week, as our historical data. A problem regarding this data is the short time span, since it does not cover holidays, or other special days, which are often at fault for massive traffical problems. We are also going to use a large data set from Beijing to simulate real-time data, this data was gathered over a period of 5 years, and include a testbase of 182 people.
