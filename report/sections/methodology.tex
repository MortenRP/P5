\section{Method}
%How will we solve the problem?
To solve the problem of traffic congestion, we process a large dataset of vehicle movements within a city to derive useful properties of roads such as speed estimation. We will use this information to find \emph{traffic patterns} in the data, such that congestion can be inferred from the history of the traffic on a given road (e.g. a main road to the university could possibly have congestion weekday from 07.00 to 09.00). We will use these patterns in a route planning process to find potentially faster routes, by avoid choosing roads going through congested areas.

%Ultimately, the agent should be able to suggest a driver of a vehicle wanting to travel from point a to b, a faster route and users of the agent should be directed away from congested areas, such that the overall congestion of a city is smaller, thus utilising the road network better.

%\subsection*{Data source \& collection}
We use two GPS datasets from Beijing. One is from 10.357 taxies over a period of a week\cite{Tdrive}. This is used to construct a training set to learn traffic patterns. The other dataset contains data from 182 people over a period of 5 years\cite{Geolife}. We use this dataset to construct a test set for evaluating the learned traffic patterns.

%If we had more time we would have collected our data on our own. A problem regarding this data is the short time span, since it does not cover holidays, or other special days, which are often at fault for massive traffic problems.

Both of the data sets was published by Microsoft Research.
