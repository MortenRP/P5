First the relevance and interested parties of the problem are discussed following a description of existing work and their limitations within this problem domain. Thereafter the problem will be more precisely defined in the problem formulation. Then the method for solving the problem formulation as well as how the solution will be evaluated in the method and solution criteria sections.
