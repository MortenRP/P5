\subsection{Current limitations}
As described in \ref{sec:ITS} the limitations road-based methods of inductive loops and sensors have issues regarding the cost of implementation and maintenance, and environmental issues with accuracy of measurements. Vehicle-based method on the other hand, has the usefulness of being less expensive and more flexible now, that most people have a GPS-enabled smart-phone or tablet in their vehicles. 
However, there are still the concern of the privacy of drivers. Tracking GPS-coordinates of vehicles enables surveillance of peoples movements, which could potentially be exploited if not handled carefully. Therefore measures must be considered to anonymize the gps-location data such that data cannot be used to backtrack individuals movements.
