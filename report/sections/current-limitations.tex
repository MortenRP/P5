\section{Current limitations}
\todo{Consider merging with existing work / move limitations from existing work into limitations}
This sections will examine the limitations of this kind of system. These limitations can be fx. security, data collection and privacy. This section will not propose a solution for these problems but focus on illuminateing them.

What are the limitations with building a smart GPS system. Data collection are the most important, for without the data there are no system. There are different ways of collecting traffic data where privacy is not a concern because there are no way of difference one car from the other. The drawback of these methods are that they are so costlig in setup and maintenance\todo{måske indsætte et billede}. Another problem is that they are static, this means that we only get the data for a small area around the measuring equipment. So there are no way of finding flow pattens for larger areas.

Then theres is the mass of data need for the system to function. If the data pull is'n larges enough and cover a large enough area, then the `presistion' of the system goes down.

Another way of collecting data is for the is for the drivers to supply them. This then raises the question if they are willing to do so. This then becomes a question about if they fell the possible downside outweigh the benefits.
