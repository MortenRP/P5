\subsection{Current limitations}
As described in \ref{sec:ITS}, the limitations of road-based methods of inductive loops and sensors cause issues regarding the cost of implementation and maintenance, and environmental issues with accuracy of measurements. Vehicle-based methods, on the other hand, have the usefulness of being less expensive and more flexible, now that most people have a GPS-enabled smart-phone or tablet in their vehicles.
However, there are still the concern of the privacy of drivers. Tracking GPS coordinates of vehicles enables surveillance of people's movements, which could potentially be exploited if not handled carefully. Therefore measures must be considered to anonymize the GPS location data such that it cannot be used to backtrack individuals' movements.
