This chapter discusses the proposed solution for the problem formulation. We first describe the architectural design of the developed system and how we model road networks. Furthermore we discuss the communication between client and server components. Then, we describe how to process the GPS data and perform data mining to deduct traffic patterns. At last, we discuss how to use the patterns in the intelligent route planning and issues regarding communicating routes and changes in routes from server to client.
