In this chapter we design and discuss a solution to the problem. We first discuss the overview of the system, followed by a description of the communication between client and server components. Then we describe how the data preprocessing is performed and how knowledge about the road network and traffic is represented. We then go on to discuss techniques for learning traffic patterns from the knowledge representation, and how to use the patterns in a route planning process.
