\chapter{Introduction}
Transportation problems arise frequently in areas with high population density. Examples that come to mind are people standing in line for services, traffic congestion on roads, and overcrowded public transportation. Many of these problems become accentuated when notable events occur, such as concerts, people going on holidays, and traffic accidents. Designing an infrastructure with these potential problems in mind can certainly minimize the troubles they cause. However, infrastructures are typically designed with a particular context in mind and consequently do not respond well to serious changes in the area, such as an increasing number of people. Costs are high when roads have to be expanded, changed, or constructed, and maintenance costs increase as roads more regularly need to be renewed when the everyday traffic in the area increases. For these reasons, it is advantageous to achieve better utilisation of road networks, such that costs of overburdened roads can be lowered as well as saving time for the people stuck in traffic congestions. This leads to an initial problem for this project: How can we analyse traffic to detect current and possibly future problems, such that initiatives for alleviating them can be considered.\todo{Læs intro.
