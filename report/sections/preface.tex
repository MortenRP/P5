This report is part of a 5th semester project at Aalborg University. The purpose of the project is to achieve a set of learning goals specified by the study regulation for Computer Science bachelors degree\todo{source}. More specifically, the goal is to achieve knowledge, skills and competencies within the fields of Machine Intelligence, which is the primary focus of this project.

Since not all project group members are following the optional machine intelligence course, machine learning techniques are supported by Distributed Systems and Network techniques. The reason for this is to also achieve knowledge, skills and competencies about this field as well since this is important for some of the group members.

%We believe we have achieved the goals of the study regulation through the work documented in the report. We have achieved knowledge, skills and competencies about different machine learning techniques through the analysis, implementation and evaluation of the techniques for learning traffic patterns.
 
We would like to extend our thanks to Fabrice Marchal and TrackMatching for being helpful and providing increased quotas for their map-matching service.
