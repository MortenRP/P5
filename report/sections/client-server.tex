\section{Client-server}
The client server interface is built upon the Java ServerSocket and the Java Socket,
which handles opening a port, accepting a connection, and connecting to such a port,
through a TCP connection.

The client server interface handles connection to the server,
sending acknowledgements of receiving the complete data,
and the management of session IDs. \todo{Skal skrives f√¶rdig}
