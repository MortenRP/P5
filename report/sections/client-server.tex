\section{Client-server communication}
\label{chap:clientserver}
As mentioned in \secref{sec:systemarchitecture} we will be using a client-server structure.
The reason behind this choice is that we have a model which is able to change at any time, and restraining the amount of local models needing to be updated is favorable.
Smartphones used by drivers will be acting as clients,
where they need to be able to send information such as location and speed to the server in some given time interval.
The server will handle this information and send it further for analysing, the server will also send updates regarding the route back to the clients.

The server and the client communicates through an interface, on the application layer, of the Internet protocol suite\todo{kan jeg ikke forst√• MP}.
The interface allows an application to set up a connection, and read and write strings.

The interface is implemented as a protocol, that is built upon the Java ServerSocket and the Java Socket,
which handles opening a port, accepting a connection, and connecting to such a port, through a TCP connection.
We chose TCP because it is a stream oriented protocol,
which is ideal for transferring a lot of sequential data from one point to another,
such as a large route planned by the system agent, without corrupting data in the transfer.
The other option would have been UDP, which is a message oriented protocol.
UDP is often used for sending messages from one point to many points,
which minimizes the time it takes for a message to be sent and received.
UDP does not remember the sequence of what it is sending, but TCP does, which is prefered in this case.

\figref{fig:clientserver} illustrates how the protocol behave.
The client sends a \textit{REQUEST\_ID} package to the server.
The server responds with a \textit{RETURN\_ID} package,
which contains an integer representing the client ID.
The server picks the ID, based on a local counter, which increases every time a new client connects to the server.
The reason the server provides the ID is to prevent clashes between two client IDs,
which might occur if the clients generated the IDs.
The client sends back an \textit{ACK} package to the server when it has received the ID.
When the client has received the ID, and then acknowledged the ID received,
the client can then send data to the server that is needed to create a new route,
or give information about the route it is following.
The server then sends an acknowledgement that it has received the data.

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{l|p{.6\textwidth}}
\textbf{Type}              & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
\textit{REQUEST\_ID}       & Package sent to server, requesting a new ID \\
\hline
\textit{RETURN\_ID}        & Response package to a \textit{REQUEST\_ID} \\
\hline
\textit{ACK}               & Sent as acknowledgement that another package was received \\
\hline
\textit{SEND\_DATA}        & Package which includes additional data \\
\hline
\textit{CLOSE\_CONNECTION} & Package sent telling the other side that the connection is closing \\
\hline
\textit{ERROR}             & Error package. Sent when a package could not be processed \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Types of packages}
\label{tab:package_types}
\end{table}

\tabref{tab:package_types} describes the different types of packages in the protocol.
A package consists of a package header, optionally followed by data.

The messages that are sent back and forth are converted into bytes.
In \figref{fig:bytesclientserver} it is illustrated how the bytes in the package header are packed.
32 bits are reserved for our ClientID, which is empty when the first message is sent to request an ID.
Next we have our RequestID which is a 16 bit integer denoting the ID of the package,
and for identifying the type of package there are 7 bits.
We have reserved one bit as a Last message bit, which is used to be able to tell if a big message,
that is split into 2 or more files has ended.
Lastly there are 8 bits for an integer which is used in case a \textit{SEND\_DATA} request i too large for a single package,
and has to be split into several packages.

The client updates its GPS location every 5 seconds, so as to be able to maintain a precise location of the client. This information, and additionally the speed, and the time is sent to the server, and can be used to learn traffic patterns.
%When a message is sent either from the client or the server,
%they are both set to wait for 5 seconds to receive the acknowledgement message, if no such message is received the message is discarded. We could have continued to try and resend the message several times, but a lost GPS coordinate from a user is not a critical problem for our system and will not have any major effect on our calculations.

To be able to show the fastest route a person should drive we have chosen to implement a map on the client. We have implemented an OpenStreetMap viewer and a getRoute method where the client asks for a route between two points, this is done by sending 2 node ids, node ids are explained in \secref{chap:FormatPre-processing}, to the server where then the fastest path is calculated between the 2 points. The server then sends GPS locations of the route which then is shown in the OpenStreetMap on the client. An illustration of this can be seen in \figref{fig:routeonmap}.
