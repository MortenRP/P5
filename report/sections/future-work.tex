In this section we will cover possibly area of (spændene) for this project. This is don to highlight topics discover during the project where there wasn't time to implement.
\section{Contraction hierarchies}\label{sec:future:contraction-hierarchies}
% What is it?
% Why use it?
% How do we use it?
The map is represented as a graph as this makes it a lot easier to work with path finding problems. The problem with representing a map this way is that the graph gits so big and there is a lot of unnecessary points for finding a route from A to B. To minimise the amount of data the graph consist of, shortcut have been introduce. These shortcuts are called segments, and they go from intersection to intersection, so all intermediate points on the original map is then ignored. This makes the graph a lot smaller and faster to search through.

\section{Map-matching}\label{sec:future:map-matching}
Map-matching as describe in section \ref{sec:mapmatching} looks at the way this project have implemented this process, but this have highlighted some problems. Given a set of way-points the mapping function will give a route if one or more of these way-points are wrong the function will still make a route with them, never looking if this is possible.

This means that the map data need to look at again to fix these errors. A solution would be to build the map-matchere ourselves "it was out of this project scope". It would allow us the merge the mapping and error detection into one process. Another possible solution could be to use another map-matching program, but more time would be need to make an informed decision on which of the service from section \ref{sec:mapmatching} to or if non of them are usable.

\section{Data gathering}
For this project to work properly, the data needed is a big part of it. Some of the problems with the data used in this project are described in section \ref{sec:datafiltering}. For the system to be able to make good decision a lot of data is needed and should be well distributed over all routs. It is hard to tell when there is enough data for each route.

To collect this data a smart and easy way needs to be in play. In section \ref{sec:existingwork} some of the possible way of collecting data is analyse. The data should consist of location, time and speed, location and time is in the data we got now but we need to calculate the speed form the data we got now. Since there can be some error with the location data then the speed calculation will yield a wrong result, and the cost function is depended on the correctness of the speed.

\section{Bi-directional A*} \label{algorithms}
The path finding algorithm describe in section \ref{sec:pathfinding} is a sub optimal for finding a path through a graph. In this section another version of an A* will be looked at, the bi-directional A* algorithm.

Bi-directional graph search is in it's simplest form just a two normal Dijkstra’s where one starts from the start node and the other starts from the goal node.
% Why use it?
The reason for using this algorithm over other graph search is that the the time for finding a path is $O(b^{(n/2)})$ where a normal Dijkstra’s takes $O(b^{n})$, where $b$ is the branching factor and $n$ is the number of nodes in the direct graph. Bi-directional also have the benefit of working well when running in paralleled.

The problem with using this algorithm with our cost function is that it is time depended and we have no way of making a good estimation of the when the driver will be at the goal node. This means that only the search from the start node will be correct with the time for the cost function.

This means that to implement a more efficient algorithm for finding a path through the graph, a way to estimate the time for when the goal node will be reach is needed.


\begin{itemize}

	\item Utility på kilder til observationer under regression generation
	\item better cleaning of GPX files (some problems with a LOT of inferred roads with no waypoints)
	\item include more features in the prediction. Min/max speed, number of vehicles on road etc....
