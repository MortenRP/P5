\section{Relevance}
Hvem er dette et problem for og hvorfor?

The focus of this project will be on vehicles, since the number of cars produced in the world are still increasing, this means that there are still getting more and more cars on the roads. Which mentioned in the introduction can be linked to several issues both to the economics of a city, but also the health of the people living there.
The problem with traffic congestion 

As mention in \secref{Introduction} there are several problems related to traffic congestion, such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wear on heavily trafficated roads
	\item Pollution
	\item Waste of work hours
	\item Stress
\end{itemize}

If the traffic can be distributed more evenly on the whole road network, the overall wear on the roads will be less, and therefore the maintaining of these roads can be more efficiently spaced. This can lead to less congestions, Since these are often a consequence of roadwork, especially on heavily trafficated roads.

One of the main things that are desired is to reduce the time wasted when waiting in line at a congestion.
The time wasted in a traffic jam is also time that the involved people could have used better, and since this time is also a stress factor for many, then there is a possibility for healthier people. 

The pollution 




Statistics are showing that the number of cars on the roads are increasing therefore it's important to come up with solutions that are aimed at distibuting the flow of traffic more evenly.

Estimates showing that the number of cars in the world are increasing year by year.\cite{http://wardsauto.com/ar/world_vehicle_population_110815} With this increase the need for more efficient traffic flow systems are nessesary, since there are several issues connected to traffic congestions.

Time
The time spent waiting in line at a congestion, is time wasted. Congestions are often a mean of people getting to and from job, these can lead to stress for many of the drivers.\cite{stress,http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/63/4/467.pdf} Which again can lead to fustrated drivers that begins to drive reckless.\cite{http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847899000029} Which can ultimatively cause even greater problems in an already congested site. Even if the stress doesn't show as fustrated drivers it might have an impact on the drivers in other parts of their life.
