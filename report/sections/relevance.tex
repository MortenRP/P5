\section{Relevance}
Hvem er dette et problem for og hvorfor?

The focus of this project will be on vehicles, since the number of cars produced in the world are still increasing, this means that there are still getting more and more cars on the roads. Which mentioned in the introduction can be linked to several issues both to the economics of a city, but also the health of the people living there.
The problem with traffic congestion 

As mention in \secref{Introduction} there are several problems related to traffic congestion, such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wear on heavily trafficated roads
	\item Pollution
	\item Waste of work hours
	\item Stress
\end{itemize}

If the traffic can be distributed more evenly on the whole road network, the overall wear on the roads will be less, and therefore the maintaining of these roads can be more efficiently spaced and therefore cause less traffic congestion.
Since traffic congestions are often a consequence of road maintaining, especially on heavily trafficated roads.

The time wasted in a traffic jam is also time that the involved people could have used better, and since this time is also a stress factor for many, then there is a possibility for healthier people. 

The pollution 




Statistics are showing that the number of cars on the roads are increasing therefore it's important to come up with solutions that are aimed at distibuting the flow of traffic more evenly.

Estimates showing that the number of cars in the world are increasing year by year.\cite{http://wardsauto.com/ar/world_vehicle_population_110815} With this increase the need for more efficient traffic flow systems are nessesary, since there are several problems connected to traffic congestions.
