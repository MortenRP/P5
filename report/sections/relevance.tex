\section{Relevance}
Estimates show that the number of cars in the world is increasing year by year.\todo{Cite source: http://wardsauto.com/ar/world\_vehicle\_population\_110815} This leads to an increase in traffic congestions, which in turn increases the need for more efficient traffic flow systems.

As mentioned in \ref{chap:introduction} there are several problems related to traffic congestion, such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wear on heavily trafficated roads
	\item Pollution
	\item Waste of work hours
	\item Stress
\end{itemize}

Road maintance often plays a large role in causing traffic congestions, especially on heavy trafficated roads. If the traffic at these roads could be more evenly distrubuted over the whole road network then it would be possible to lover the need for regular maintance at a single road.

One of the main things that are desired is to reduce the time wasted when waiting in line at a congestion.
The time wasted in a traffic jam is also time that the involved people could have used better, and since this time is also a stress factor for many, then there is a possibility for healthier people.

Pollution\todo{Write something about pollution}

The time spent waiting in line at a congestion, is time wasted. Congestions are often a mean of people getting to and from job, these can lead to stress for many of the drivers.\todo{Cite source: (stress-related) http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/63/4/467.pdf} Which again can lead to frustrated drivers that begins to drive reckless.\todo{Cite source: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847899000029} Which can ultimately cause even greater problems in an already congested site. Even if the stress doesn't show as frustrated drivers it might have an impact on the drivers in other parts of their life.
