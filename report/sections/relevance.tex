\section{Relevance}
Estimates show that the number of cars in the world is increasing year by year\cite{WardsAuto:CarPopulation}. \todo{source and argumentation}This leads to an increase in traffic congestions, which in turn increases the need for more efficient traffic flow systems.

There are several problems related to traffic congestion, such as:
\todo{Omdan bulletpoints til sammenhængende tekst}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wear on heavily trafficated roads
	\item Pollution
	\item Waste of work hours
	\item Stress
\end{itemize}

One of the main things that are desired is to reduce the time wasted when waiting in line at a congestion.
The time wasted in a traffic jam is also time that the involved people could have used better, and since this time is also a stress factor for many, then there is a possibility for healthier people\todo{Hvad kan det ellers nedsætte}.

Congestions are often a mean of people getting to and from job, these can lead to stress for many of the drivers.\todo{Cite source: (stress-related) http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/63/4/467.pdf} Which again can lead to frustrated drivers that begins to drive reckless.\todo{Cite source: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847899000029} Which can ultimately cause even greater problems in an already congested site. Even if the stress does not show as frustrated drivers it might have an impact on the drivers in other parts of their life.
\todo{Write about better/even utilization of roads --> may cause less maintenance of roads --> reduced costs}
\todo{Less time spent in cars --> less emissions --> less polution and usage of fosile fuels}
\todo{Back up claims of reckless driving / strees factor}
\todo{Back whole chapter up with financial numbers e.g. costs per year of traffic jams}
\todo{Write: pollution of cars in traffic and in congestions}
